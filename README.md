# Better Blocker

The Chrome extension blockers that I've been using have lacked the features that I needed for my purposes, so I made my own website blocker!

## What it does

- Blocks everything on a given domain except for exceptions based on which strings the URL contains
    - This would allow you to unblock Reddit comment sections, Twitter threads, etc. while blocking the doomscrolling of the feeds
- Shows a custom message when you try to access blocked content
- Nuclear option to stop you from making changes for a given amount of time, when you want to lock in

## How to install

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder
5. Click the extension icon to configure your blocked sites

## How to use

Click the extension icon to open settings:
- Add domains to completely block
- Set up path-specific exceptions
- Customize the block message
